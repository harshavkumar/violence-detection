======

`imgaug` is a library for image augmentation in machine learning experiments.
It supports a wide range of augmentation techniques, allows to easily combine
these, has a simple yet powerful stochastic interface, can augment images
and keypoints/landmarks on these and offers augmentation in background
processes for improved performance.
